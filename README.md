# Random Cat Facts Generator 🐾

This is a simple and fun JavaScript project that fetches random cat facts from the [CatFact API](https://catfact.ninja/) and displays them on a webpage when a button is clicked.  

## Features 🚀
- Fetches random cat facts using an API.
- Displays the fact dynamically on the webpage.
- Uses modern JavaScript features like `async/await` for fetching data.
- Error handling to display a fallback message in case of any issues.

## How It Works ⚙️
1. A button is present on the webpage.
2. When the button is clicked, an API request is made to fetch a random cat fact.
3. The fact is then displayed inside a `<p>` tag.
